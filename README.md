# OCD: Obsessively Curated Dotfiles

A Git-backed dotfile management workflow with minimal complexity by using a bare local repository and `$HOME` as the [work tree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). By setting `showUntrackedFiles no`, you only see purposefully staged files for commits. Managing changes is easy, and setting up a new shell only takes a few seconds. It avoids the usual tangle of symlinks by relying on a bare local Git repo and setting the [work tree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to `$HOME`. It requires minimal extra code.

For more than 20 years I maintained a little pet script that did the usual symlink-farm approach, because I felt like [every other option](https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/) was too much extra code and complexity. Then I found this minimal and elegant suggestion in [an old comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754) by [StreakyCobra](https://github.com/StreakyCobra). Atlassian did a nice [write-up](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) about it, too. So, I said goodbye to my trusty little 20 year old pet 💔.

Below, I'll explain a very slightly more detailed approach to make this work, and how to use the `ocd-install.sh` script I wrote.

## Philosophy

- Store dotfiles in `~/.ocd` (a bare repo).
- Work directly in `$HOME` with `ocd` as the Git command alias. (`git --git-dir=$HOME/.ocd --work-tree=$HOME`)
- Use an extensive `.gitignore_ocd` so you don’t accidentally commit secrets or random junk.
- Keep everything simple—no thousands of lines of code or complicated scripts.

## Basic Idea

1. **Create or pick a GitHub repo** for your dotfiles. Make sure your SSH keys are set up for the remote side.

2. **Clone it as a bare repo** in your `$HOME`. Something like:

```bash
git clone --bare git@github.com:USER/dotfiles.git $HOME/.ocd
git --git-dir=$HOME/.ocd --work-tree=$HOME config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```
3. **Add an alias** like `ocd` to your shell environment:

`.bashrc`:

```bash
alias ocd='git --git-dir=$HOME/.ocd --work-tree=$HOME'
```

4. **Start versioning**:

```bash
ocd status
ocd add .bashrc
ocd commit -m "Add .bashrc"
ocd push origin main
```

## Automated First-Time Setup

The `ocd-install.sh` script will ask for your existing remote repo URL (GitHub or otherwise) that you'll use for your dotfiles. If you already have one with dotfiles in it, that's OK as long as the files are at the root of the repo. If you already have files in it, **this setup will overwrite your local versions**!

The `ocd-install.sh` script will offer a pre-commit hook to make sure you don't accidentally add your entire home directory by flagging commits with more than 20 files. It will also offer to download a massive `.gitignore` file to keep you from accidentally checking in secrets and other junk files. At the time of this writing it has 8421 rules in it.

Running the script looks something like this:

```console
$ ./ocd-install.sh
This will create a bare local repo for managing dotfiles (well, ANY files)
using your homedir as the work tree and a remote repo for backup/sync.

WARNING! If you use a remote repo with existing dotfiles, this will clobber
your local versions. If you're not ready for that, you should ctrl-c your
way out of here.

For the remote repo, you will need its SSH key set up already.

Enter the Git remote URL for your dotfiles (e.g., git@github.com:USER/REPO.git).
URL: git@github.com:luser/dotfiles.git

Tip: Use "ocd check-ignore -v /home/luser/.gitignore_ocd" to troubleshoot matching rules.

[*] ALL DONE!

[!] Don't forget this in your .bashrc/.zsh/etc.:

  # Use "ocd" to manage dotfiles in $HOME.
  alias ocd='git --git-dir=$HOME/.ocd --work-tree=$HOME'

  # Update .gitignore_ocd file.
  alias ocd-update-ignore='curl -sL "https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/$(curl -sL https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/list | xargs | sed '\''s/ /,/g'\'')" > $HOME/.gitignore_ocd'

After sourcing your file with the new alias you can just do "ocd add", "ocd commit", and so forth.

Save a one-liner like this to set everything up on other machines, AFTER
your SSH key is available on them; it's pretty close to a one-shot config:

  git clone --bare git@github.com:luser/dotfiles.git "$HOME/.ocd" && \
      alias ocd="git --git-dir="$HOME/.ocd" --work-tree=$HOME" && \
      ocd config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no && \
      ocd config --local core.excludesFile "$HOME/.gitignore_ocd" && \
      ocd pull && \
      source "$HOME/.bashrc"

$ alias ocd='git --git-dir=$HOME/.ocd --work-tree=$HOME'

$ ocd status
On branch main
nothing to commit (use -u to show untracked files)

$ vi .bashrc

[add the "ocd" alias and such to your .bashrc]

$ ocd status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .bashrc

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

$ ocd commit -a
